The goal of monkeytest is to add variations of testing mechanics that mimic that of [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat) that are useful to catch errors of test smells.

## Installation

You can install the development version of monkeytest like so:

``` r
# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("emilhvitfeldt/monkeytest")
```

## Example

The `*_pure()` family of functions mirrors the testthat functions except that they only evaluate `test_that()` calls. This can be a useful tool to check if your tests are properly self contained.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Use
test_local_pure()
# Instead of 
test_local()
```

These functions should not be used on a regular basis, but can be useful to clean up your tests and identify failure points.
